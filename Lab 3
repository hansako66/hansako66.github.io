        Hello! My name is Hans Ako, and I am currently a fourth-year undergraduate student at the University of California, Riverside (UCR), majoring in Biology. My academic journey and extracurricular experiences have shaped my passion for healthcare, scientific discovery, and community engagement. With a solid foundation in biological sciences and hands-on experience in both clinical and fitness settings, I am excited to pursue a career that combines my love for science with compassionate patient care.

Throughout my time at UCR, I have focused on developing a strong academic foundation in subjects such as physiology, microbiology, and cellular biology, while also actively engaging in volunteer work that reflects my commitment to service. My coursework has challenged me to think critically, conduct research, and understand the intricacies of the human body. These studies have not only honed my scientific reasoning but also deepened my interest in pursuing a healthcare-related profession in the future.

Beyond the classroom, I have consistently sought opportunities to apply my knowledge and skills in real-world settings. I served as a Certified Nursing Assistant (CNA) for a year, where I provided direct patient care in a clinical environment. This role taught me the importance of empathy, communication, and attention to detailâ€”skills that are essential in any medical or health-focused profession. Working closely with patients and healthcare teams gave me invaluable insight into the physical and emotional aspects of patient care.

For the past two years, I have also worked as a FitWell Attendant at UCR, where I support the universityâ€™s mission of promoting health and wellness. In this role, I assist with the day-to-day operations of the campus recreation center, help students and staff maintain safe workout practices, and contribute to creating a welcoming environment for all members. This experience has allowed me to better understand the importance of preventative care and holistic wellness, bridging the gap between physical fitness and overall health.

In addition to my professional and academic experiences, I have been involved in multiple volunteer opportunities that reflect my dedication to serving the community. Whether assisting at local health fairs, mentoring fellow students, or helping with campus events, I strive to make a positive impact wherever I can. These roles have reinforced my belief in the importance of outreach and education, particularly when it comes to public health.

As I approach graduation, I am eager to continue building on these experiences. I am currently exploring career paths in healthcare, public health, and research, with the long-term goal of contributing to a more equitable and effective healthcare system. I am passionate about making science accessible, delivering compassionate care, and working with diverse populations.

Thank you for visiting my pageâ€”I look forward to sharing more about my journey and aspirations as I move forward in the world of biology and healthcare.
